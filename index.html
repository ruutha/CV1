    <p>HelloüëãüèøI'm Ruth Atagbuzia. A life-long learner currently picking up new skills on how to create websites alongside learning the tools needed to become a successful data analyst. My co-op work experiences helped me grow to love working with people to provide excellent customer experience and analyze data for various projects. 
       My experience includes conducting administrative duties at the front desk, processing student data for campus-wide events, and compiling data for competitor analysis.</p>
